Welcome to Music To My Ears! The musical ear training app designed for the musical novice who wants to develop 
and identify intervals (the difference between two pitches) in music. 

Designed with React.js, sign up or log in to play our game which stores user information and score collection in MongoDB. 
Gain as many points as possible in the allotted time frame (120 seconds) by playing back the correct sequence of notes that 
are randomly generated from the npm package, "tone.js".

For a deeper understanding, select the interval box in the top left corner for example of different intervales, i.e. Ascending
Minor Second Songs such as the theme song to "Jaws" or "White Christmas."
