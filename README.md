Music Ear Training App
By: TJ Leis, Michael Mensinger, Sadiki Saunders, Han Sung

	We are developing an application which is a learning/game experience. Our app focuses on ear training which is very important and potentially transformational in terms of a musician’s ability to play music by ear. Our app will utilize multiple API’s but the primary API we will be leveraging is tone.js which is a web audio framework for making interactive music in the browser. The main page of our app will be an on-screen keyboard which the user will interact with.  A main exercise in our game is going to be the identification of intervals. In music theory an interval is characterized as the difference between two pitches. Our app focuses strongly on associations.  For example, think of the first two notes in the Star Wars theme, that interval is called a perfect fifth.  The computer will first run through a series of notes highlighting the keyboard keys along the way.  Afterwards it is the user’s objective to mimic the sounds heard on-screen using the understanding of intervals.  We will have a reference box to the side of the keyboard with short snippets of popular songs; each relating to a particular interval which the user can go to for a hint.  Our app will utilize MongoDB to store the user’s high scores and progress. Our app will have different difficulty levels as well as the ability to slow down the music as to better hear each note.  This is our MVP however we plan on expanding our app into other aspects of learning music by ear.
